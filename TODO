check partial parse performance of attoparsec?

performance might be fine, since Meshlab needs 20 sec to open xyz file,
test binary formats next

pass handle into sinks from outside, making it easier to stream from multiple conduits
this also makes sources easier, since the parsers can just keep on going

some parsers require an empty line at the end of the input (skipRestOfLine the newline should be optional)
