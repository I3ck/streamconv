profiling via
stack build --profile
stack exec streamconv -- +RTS -p

proper testing framework

laserscanner formats

need withBinaryFile and readBinaryFile ?

support other off formats ( http://www.geomview.org/docs/html/OFF.html )

disallow transform to same type?

determine input format automatically

only require bin flag for output and determine type from ending?

give entire lib a module name (Streamconv) ?

remove prefixes / suffixes such as sources and sinks and simply include qualified

should be possible to implement 'triple' transformer in such a way that it only writes a tmp file for the position data
