check partial parse performance of attoparsec?

performance might be fine, since Meshlab needs 20 sec to open xyz file,
test binary formats next

pass handle into sinks from outside, making it easier to stream from multiple conduits
this also makes sources easier, since the parsers can just keep on going

some parsers require an empty line at the end of the input (skipRestOfLine the newline should be optional)

plyVertex parser also consumes the index list, should either parse at most N elements or disallow non-floating
-> use try or <|> in combination with decimal to only allow real doubles

proper testing framework

laserscanner formats

obj face indices start at 1 !

todo .xy source

stl binary source

resolve issues with conversion between stl like format of only positions and index list logic by writing temporary files

facet normal in stl must be indented

mixed import of Bytestring Lazy as BL or BSL

need withBinaryFile and readBinaryFile ?
